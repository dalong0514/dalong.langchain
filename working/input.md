A mathematical model representing a product or a process is a logical starting point for most calculations involving simulation/design of the product and/or process. As pointed out in Chapter 1, the product/process mathematical model typically consists of three types of equations - balance equations, constitutive equations and constraint equations - where the set of selected property models represent the constitutive equations while the condition of equilibrium state is imposed through the constraint equations. The result is that selection of the property model(s) affects the simulation and design results.

Recently, Gani and O'Connell [1] and O'Connell and Neurock [2] highlighted the roles of property models in computer aided process/product engineering applications. According to Gani and O'Connell, the property models play three distinctive roles in process/product design - a service role (provides a specified set of property values when requested), a service plus advice role (in addition to providing the specified property values, the property models are used to advise on the feasibility of operation/design), and an integration role (in addition to the above, the property models contribute directly to the strategy of solving the problem). Therefore, the roles of the property models need to be recognized not only during their selection and use, but even during the development of design (simulation) algorithms.

Typically, properties play a service role in simulation, a service plus advice role in design and an integration role in developing efficient and flexible simulation-design strategies. In simulation, for example, the property models provide values for fugacity coefficients, enthalpies, etc., when requested during calculations involving mass and energy balance equations representing a process flowsheet. In design of equilibrium-based separation processes, property values explicitly indicate the feasibility of a desired type of separation and implicitly identify the conditions (design or operation) at which the desired separation could be possible. For example, for a non-azeotropic mixture, the values of relative volatility identify when separation by distillation may be feasible, while the ratios of melting points of binary pairs of compounds of interest identify if separation by crystallization might be feasible. Since the equilibrium properties depend only on intensive variables (temperature, pressure and/or composition), their constitutive equations can be used to design a desired separation operation. For example, if only temperature and pressure need to be specified, the first step it to select values where the corresponding equilibrium properties will have the desired separation (commonly the specified as a percentage recovery of a chemical of desired purity) be matched.
